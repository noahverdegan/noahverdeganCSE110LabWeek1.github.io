### Here is a picture of my dog with a mask photoshopped on.

As she once so eloquently said:

> Bark

#### Now for a list of her positive qualities
- She is cute
- She is small
  - Only 3 pounds!
  - Convenient and portable!
  - Filled with more chihuahua rage than should be able to fit in her tiny body!
- Makes being stuck at home not entirely depressing

### To do list:
- [x] Take screenshot of command line
- [x] Take screenshot of VS Code
- [x] Include my dog
- [ ] Make a page that is actually useful
