[Here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/CSE101/) is a link to the class webpage.

**Wow some happy bold text**

*Fancy Italics*

~~Very Useful Code Ahead~~
```
while(false){
  int i = 0;
  i += i;
}
```

### Order in which I did this assignment
1. Make repository on github
2. Clone, branch, and edit using command line
3. Branch and edit using VS Code
4. Edit on github to add required markdown elements


### Here is a picture of my dog with a mask photoshopped on.

As she once so eloquently said:

> Bark

#### Now for a list of her positive qualities
- She is cute
- She is small
  - Only 3 pounds!
  - Convenient and portable!
  - Filled with more chihuahua rage than should be able to fit in her tiny body!
- Makes being stuck at home not entirely depressing

### Helpful Table That Definitely Renders Properly  

| Column Title | Another Column | How Exciting More Column |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Oh my first item | This in second Column | wowza 3rd column |  
| Wow a second row | *Slant* | ~~Crossed out~~ |
| Another exciting row | taBlE | final item |  

### To do list:
- [x] Take screenshot of command line
- [x] Take screenshot of VS Code
- [x] Include my dog
- [ ] Make a page that is actually useful
